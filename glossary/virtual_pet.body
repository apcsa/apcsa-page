<p>A virtual pet, as referred to in this course, is a palm-sized, toy that contains a screen and a few buttons.
The owner interacts with the pet by pressing the buttons (to do things like feed and play with the pet), while the
screen shows an image of the pet's current state.  One of the first of these toys was called a <em>Tamagotchi</em>.
