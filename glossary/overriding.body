<p> 
Overriding occurs when a subclass has a method with the same <A href="glossary.php?term=signature">signature</A> as a method in 
its superclass (or the superclass of its superclass, and so on upwards).

In this situation, the method of the subclass will be invoked, and is <i>overriding</i> the method in the superclass(es).
