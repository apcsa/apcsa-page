<p> 
The merge sort algorithm is a recursive sorting algorithm that can be quite efficient.  In the merge sort process, the set to be sorted 
is broken into separate sets, each of which are sorted (recursively).  Then, the two already sorted sets are merged together with a single pass through
each.
