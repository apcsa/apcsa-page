<p>To invoke a method (behavior) for an object instance, you have to first make an object and have it in 
the BlueJ object bench.  Then, right-click on the object in the object bench; the context menu will
list all of the object's available methods, excluding <tt>private</tt> methods.
If the method takes parameters, BlueJ will present a dialog box in which you can set them.</p>
