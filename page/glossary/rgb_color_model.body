<p> 
The RGB color model, or the Red-Green-Blue color model is a method of representing all colors as different intensities
of red, green, and blue colors.  For instance, the color blue can be represented as 
full intensity of blue and zero intensity of both red and green.  Intensities are commonly, but not always, represented
as integers between 0 and 255.
Black would be represented as no red, no green, and no blue, while white would be represented as full intensity of
each of red, green, and blue.
