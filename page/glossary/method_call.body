A method is often coded so that it can be started (called) several times 
and/or from several places during a single execution of the program, 
including from other subroutines, and branch back (return) to the point 
after the call once its task is done.

The main component of a method is its body, the piece of program that is 
executed when the method is called, and defines its effect.
