   A flow chart is a type of diagram used to indicate how a program
   or program segment functions.  It consists of nodes connected by
   arrows.  Nodes are labeled, and can be of different types, such
   as decision nodes that have more than a single arrow leaving them,
   termination nodes which have no arrows leaving them and indicate
   that the program has stopped, and so forth.
