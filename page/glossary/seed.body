<p> 
A seed is a parameter given to a <a href="glossary.php?term=pseudo-random_number_generator">
pseudo-random number generator</a>.  In most generators, the seed is a number,
and different seeds will produce different sequences of pseudo-random numbers.  
</p>
<p>
In good generators&mdash;that is, ones that
generate numbers that appear quite random&mdash;seeds that are quite close to each other
will still produce pseudo-random numbers that don't appear related in any way.
