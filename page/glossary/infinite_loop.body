<p> 
An infinite loop occurs when a <A href="glossary.php?term=loop">loop</A> never terminates inside
a running program.  This is most often an error, but is sometimes used to repeat actions until the
user stops the program by some means outside of the program itself (for instance, by turning off the computer!).
