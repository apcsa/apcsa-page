<p>
Digitally recorded sounds contain samples of the air pressure over time.
An individual sample, then, is a single measurement of pressure.  This
is almost always recorded as an integer.  The individual samples in
sounds typically on 
compact discs are integers that vary between -32768 and 32768, implying
that there are more than 65,000 levels of pressure that can be detected.</p>
