<p>A <b>tester class</b> is a Java class whose sole purpose is to test another
class or classes.   Commonly, a tester class will </p>
<ul>
<li>first create an instance or instances of 
class(es) to be tested,</li> 
<li>then repeatedly set up state and call methods on the instances, comparing the 
results with known correct results, and</li>
<li>finally, report whether the class(es) to be tested passed or failed the tests.</li>
</ul>
