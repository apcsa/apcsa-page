A method is a subroutine that is exclusively associated either with 
a class (in which case it is called a class method or a static method) 
or with an object (in which case it is an instance method). Like a 
subroutine in procedural programming languages, a method usually consists 
of a sequence of programming statements to perform an action, a set of 
input parameters to customize those actions, and possibly an output value 
(called the return value) of some kind. Methods provide a mechanism for 
accessing and manipulating the encapsulated data stored in an object.
