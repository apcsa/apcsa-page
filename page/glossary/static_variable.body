<p> 
A static variable is one that is available to all instances in that class within which it is defined.  If one instance of the
class changes the variable, then all the other instances will also see the new value.</p>
<p>
Static variables include the keyword <tt>static</tt> in front of them.  In this course, we will focus on static instance variables, 
rather than static variables inside methods (this later form is legal Java, and creates a method variable that any instance can 
get at from within that method).</p>

<!--  TODO   yeah, an example would be nice. -->
