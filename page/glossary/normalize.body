In digital audio recordings, normalization is the process of making the sound as loud as possible
while still keeping the full range of volume.  This is done by setting  the loudest value
in the recording to the loudest value possible, and correspondingly increasing all the 
other values so that they keep the same ratio between silence and the loudest sound as they
did before normalization.
