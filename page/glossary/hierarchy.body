<p> 
A hierarchy is an arrangment of elements in which some elements are linked, or related, to other elements as either
above or below them.  Java classes form a hierarchy with <a href="glossary.php?term=superclass">superclasses</a>
and <a href="glossary.php?term=subclass">subclasses</a> related to eachother through inheritance.  In a Java class hierarchy, 
each subclass can have a single superclass that it is related to.
