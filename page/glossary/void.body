<p>
Methods in java can return values or just perform an operation and return nothing. <tt>void</tt> is used as the return type for a method that doesn't return a value.
<br/><br/>
Example:
<pre>
			public <u>void</u> calculateAverage()
			{
				//no values returned
			}
			</pre>

			as opposed to
		<pre>
			public <u>double</u> calculateAverage(double num1, double num2)
			{	
				return num1/num2;
			}
		</pre>
</p>
