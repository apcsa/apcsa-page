<p>An instance variable is a location for storing data.  An instance variable is contained
within objects (and can be compared to a <em>class variable</em>, which is 
contained inside classes).  An instance variable has a name, which any method 
available to that object can use to refer to the variable, and a type, which 
defines the type of data that the variable can store.
