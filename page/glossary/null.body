<p>
   <tt>null</tt> is a value in Java that means 
   "empty" or "nothing".  Any type of data
   <i>besides int, boolean, and double</i> 
   can have a value of <tt>null</tt> (there 
   are others that we don't touch on in this course).
   Note: <tt>null</tt> is not the same as 
   <tt>0</tt>.  Additionally, a null
   value for a <tt>String</tt> variable is
   different than <tt>""</tt>, or the string 
   without anything in it.
