<p>
Data that is given to a method when it is called,
and then copied into the corresponding 
<a href="glossary.php?term=parameter">parameter</a>.
(A parameter is a place holder; the corresponding argument is what
it's holding a place for.)
Methods can be written to accept 
any number of arguments, each of which has a name and a type.
Arguments allow methods to do different things
depending on what arguments they are given when called.
