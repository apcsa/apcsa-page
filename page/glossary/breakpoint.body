<p>
   A breakpoint is used in a debugger to stop execution of a 
   program at a specific line.  Most development environments,
   including BlueJ, 
   allow breakpoints to be set in the editor, and will show the 
   debugger when the breakpoint is reached during execution.
   In BlueJ,
   clicking on the line number at the left of the editor window 
   sets a breakpoint for that line.
