<p>
   An interface is a specification, or contract, implemented by
   classes.   A particular interface will specify which methods
   need to be included in a class.   
</p>
<p>
   A class uses the <a href="glossary.php?term=implements">implements</a>
   keyword in the 
   <a href="glossary.php?term=class_header">class header</a> to specify
   the particular interface to which the class will use.
