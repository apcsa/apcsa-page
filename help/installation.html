                <li>Installing Java on <b>Mac</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A recent JDK (Java Development Kit) version is installed by default on Mac OS X systems. You should not need to install Java on your Mac OS X system.  Hooray!</li>
                        <li>Note: BlueJ requires Java 2 or later.  If BlueJ will not install on your system, try updating to the latest Java version (via the Software Update feature).</li>
                    </ul>
                 <li>Installing BlueJ and the coures files</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Download the file: <a href="../../program/UC-College-Prep-AP-Computer-Science-Installer-mac.zip">UC College Prep AP Computer Science Mac Installer</a>.</li>
                        <li>Double-click on the <strong>UC-College-Prep-AP-Computer-Science-Installer-mac.zip</strong> file that you just downloaded. This will unpack the zip file and a file called <strong>UC-College-Prep-AP-Computer-Science-Installer-mac</strong> will show up in the same folder that your downloaded zip file was in.</li>
                        <li>Double-click on the <strong>UC-College-Prep-AP-Computer-Science-Installer-mac</strong> file to run the installer. This will open up an install wizard. Step through the wizard to complete the installation.</li>
                        <li>The installer first checks that you have certain minimum requirements for your computer.  It will then install BlueJ, a special BlueJ extension, and the course files that you will be working with on your computer. </li>
                        <li>BlueJ will be installed in the directory <strong>/UCCP/APCSA/BlueJ</strong> (please do not change the location of this directory when you run the installer). In this directory, use the <strong>BlueJ</strong> application to run BlueJ.</li>
                        <li>The first time you start BlueJ you will need to configure it, go to the <a href="configure_bluej.php">Configure BlueJ Page</a> and follow the directions to help you configure BlueJ.</li>
                        <li>Note: if you already have BlueJ installed on your computer, you must still run the UC College Prep AP Computer Science Installer. It is ok to have mulitple BlueJs installed on your computer.</li>

					   <li>We have provided an installer for all Windows operating systems.</li>
					   <li>Download the file: <a href="../../program/UC-College-Prep-AP-Computer-Science-Installer-pc.exe">UC College Prep AP Computer Science PC Installer</a>.</li>
					   <li>Double-click on the <strong>UC-College-Prep-AP-Computer-Science-pc.exe</strong> file that you just downloaded. This will open up an install wizard. Step through the wizard to complete the installation.</li>
