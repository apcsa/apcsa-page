            <ol>
                <li><b>Operating System:</b> While this course does
                    not require a particularly powerful computer, you
                    won't be able to run Java on ChromeOS (a
                    ChromeBook). Rather, you will need a computer with
                    Windows, Macintosh, or Linux.

                    enabled and connection to the Internet. &nbsp;
                    Chrome (Windows or Mac) is the optimal browser for
                    this course.</li>
                <li><b>Java</b>. Java is required to run the BlueJ
                    toolset. See below for installation instructions.</li>
                <li><b>BlueJ</b>. You'll use this integrated
                    development environment to write your code. See
                    below for installation instructions.</li>

                <br>

                </li>
                <li>The Java SE development kit (JDK) You will be
                    doing Java development (!), and the Java runtime
                    environment (JRE) is not enough.<br> <br>
                    You can get the latest from Oracle (check <a
                    href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
                        this page</a>). <br> <br> Note: BlueJ
                    requires Java 5 or later.

                    through your browser, and doesn't require
                    installation. However, to do your programming, you
                    will need to install Java files on your computer.<br>
